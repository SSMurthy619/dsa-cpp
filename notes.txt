g++ main.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra
What does this command mean?
g++ main.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra


Let’s break it piece by piece (this is interview-level understanding).

g++

The GNU C++ compiler

Takes your C++ code → machine code (exe)

main.cpp

Your source file

-std=c++17

Use C++17 standard

Why?

Most FAANG interviews assume C++17

Enables:

auto

unordered_map

vector, lambda

Structured bindings

Without this flag, compiler may default to older C++.

-O2

Optimization level 2

Makes your code:

Faster

More efficient

Does NOT change correctness

Same flag used in:

Competitive programming

Production builds

For interviews:

Shows you know professional compilation

Matches real-world performance expectations

-Wall

Enable common warnings

Finds bugs like:
Unused variables
Missing return statements
Implicit conversions
Warnings ≠ errors
But catching them early = better code

-Wextra
Enable extra warnings
Catches:
Suspicious logic
Hidden bugs
Bad practices
FAANG interviewers LOVE clean, warning-free code.

Suggested command
Because it:
Matches industry + interview standards
Trains you to write clean, correct C++
Catches bugs early
Builds professional habits

If your code compiles with -Wall -Wextra → it’s usually solid.

What happens if you skip these?
Skip	Result
-std=c++17	STL features may fail
-Wall	Silent bugs
-Wextra	Missed edge cases
-O2	Slower runtime (minor but real)
