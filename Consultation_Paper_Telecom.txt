INTRODUCTION 
1. The telecom sector in India has grown rapidly in last decades. From a 
subscriber base of around 90 million in March, 2006, the number of 
telecom subscribers in India reached around 1.04 billion by June 2016. 
These subscribers filed approximately 10.23 million complaints just in the 
Jan-March Quarter in 2016 with the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs). The 
complaints were on account of wrong billing, indifferent or poor quality of 
service, non-provision of contracted services, etc. Unsatisfactory resolution 
of the consumer complaints, by the TSPs, is resulting in complaints and 
grievances being forwarded to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 
(TRAI) and Department of Telecom (DoT) on a regular basis. 
2. It is imperative that consumer complaints and public grievances in the 
telecom space are resolved in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner 
through a system that is easily available all across the country. Without 
such a system, benefits of the telecom revolution, which encompasses 
provision of a variety of services, such as banking, money transfer, govt. 
services, to the public will miss the intended target.     
3. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Act was enacted with the 
objective to protect the interest of consumers of the telecom sector and to 
promote and ensure orderly growth of telecom sector. The Preamble of this 
Act, reads: 
“An Act to provide for the establishment of the [Telecom Regulatory 
Authority of India and the Telecom Disputes Settlement and 
Appellate Tribunal to regulate the telecommunication services, 
adjudicate disputes, dispose of appeals and to protect the 
interests of service providers and consumers of the telecom 
5 
sector, to promote and ensure orderly growth of the telecom sector,] 
and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” 
Emphasis added 
However, the TRAI Act does not envisage redressal of individual consumer 
complaints/ grievances by the Authority. It provides that the Authority shall 
lay down standards of quality of service to be provided by the service 
providers and ensure that the quality of service is actually provided. The 
Authority, in discharge of this function, has mandated several measures, 
through Regulations, Tariff Orders, and Directions that secure and protect 
the consumer interest including on how the TSPs must resolve the 
consumer complaints/ grievances. Regular independent audits and 
customer surveys are conducted by TRAI to monitor actual implementation.  
Adherence to the Authority’s Regulations regarding consumer complaint 
redressal is enforced by the DoT, which in the licensing conditions for the 
TSPs stipulates “All complaints of subscribers in this regard will be 
addressed/ handled as per the orders or regulations or directions issued by 
the Licensor or TRAI from time to time.” 
4. In year 2000, the TRAI Act 1997 was amended to create the Telecom 
Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) which has been given 
the responsibility of dispute resolution in Section 14 of the Act.  However, 
the TDSAT has been given powers to adjudicate any dispute only - 
(i) between a licensor and a licensee; 
(ii) between two or more service providers; 
(iii) between a service provider and a group of consumers; 
The same Section places matters relating to the complaint of an individual 
consumer maintainable before a Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum or a 
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the National Consumer 
Redressal Commission established under section 9 of the Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986 (68 of 1986) beyond the powers of the TDSAT to 
6 
consider. Thus, in the present framework, TRAI has laid down the 
regulations for quality of service and mechanism for redressal of consumer 
grievances and complaints; the DoT has through licensing conditions 
enjoined upon the TSPs to adhere to these regulations and the TSPs manage 
both - the complaint redressal as well as the appellate mechanisms, to 
resolve consumer complaints/ grievances. 
As stated above, a consumer has the option to file a case with 
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum or a Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission or the National Consumer Redressal Commission in case he or 
she is not satisfied with the resolution of the complaint by his/her telecom 
service provider. Since amount involved in most of the consumer complaints 
related to telecom service is very meagre in comparison to the litigation cost 
and in view of the time taken by the Consumer Courts/Forums in deciding 
the case, consumers in general are not willing to approach the Consumer 
Courts/Forums for redressal of their complaints.  
5. In 2004, when the subscriber numbers were far fewer, considering this 
framework inadequate the Authority had released a ‘Consultation Paper on 
Establishment of the Office of Ombudsman in the Telecommunication 
Sector’1. After the stakeholder consultation process, the Authority had made 
the following recommendations2 to the Government: 
(a) Establishment of an Ombudsman would be a desirable development 
and such an institution needs to be established; 
(b) Ombudsman to be created by amendment to Licence; 
(c) 
Once the proposal is accepted in principle, the locations and staffing 
pattern etc. of the Ombudsman can be finalized by the Government, in 
consultation with the Authority;

Industry dated 10.08.2004

(d) Funding of the Office of Ombudsman may be provided from the licence 
fee collected annually from the telecom sector. A very negligible 
percentage of the revenue of the service providers (for less than 0.01%) 
will be sufficient to meet the expenses; and   
(e) 
Ombudsman should handle and investigate all unresolved complaints 
within a time frame. The Ombudsman would facilitate through its 
mediation, the terms for the resolution, settlement and/or withdrawal 
of the complaints. The unresolved complaints will inevitably go to the 
Consumer Courts. 
6. These recommendations were, however, not agreed to by the Government3.  
7. The Indian telecom sector has since 2004 witnessed phenomenal growth; it 
is poised to becoming one of the largest in the world. It has reached all 
corners of the country and populace. There has been a sea change in the 
profile of the Indian telecom consumers. Today a mobile phone is necessary 
for all sections of the society whatever their wherewithal be. The role and 
impact of telecommunication services has metamorphosed from being a 
communication tool to a critical instrument for the social and economic 
development of the country.  It is therefore appropriate to revisit the issue of 
redressal of individual consumer complaints and grievances in the telecom 
space. This paper is issued with this objective.  This Paper presents an 
overview of the existing consumer grievance mechanisms and its efficacy; 
the mechanisms in place in other countries and within India in other 
sectors of similar size and impact; and the problem areas. It seeks views, 
opinions and comments for possible options/ alternatives from 
stakeholders.
